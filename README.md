# Urban-Sound-Classification

The goal of the project was to use and compare two diffent algorithm to classify urban sounds. The algorithms used were K Neighbors Classifier and Artificial Neural Network. In both algorithms it was tried to have the best acuracy possible and in the end it was compared the two algorithms.

The sounds of the dataset are divided into 10 different categories: air conditioner; car horn; children playing; dog bark; drilling; engine idling; gun shot; jackhammer; siren;street music.
   
The best accuracy was accomplished by using K neighbours and it was achieved an accuracy of 93.06 % in the test set.
